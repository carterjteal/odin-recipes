    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Toast is bread that has been browned by radiant heat. The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction, altering
        the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common
        method of making stale bread more palatable. Bread is often toasted using a toaster, but toaster ovens are also
        used.</p>
    <p>Toast is commonly eaten with butter or margarine, or sweet toppings, such as jam or jelly. Regionally, savory
        spreads, such as peanut butter or a yeast extract, may also be popular. Buttered toast may also accompany savory
        dishes, especially soups or stews, and be topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or baked beans as a light
        meal.</p>
